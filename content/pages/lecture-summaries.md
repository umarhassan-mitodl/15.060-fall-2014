Decision Analysis I - Kendall Crab & Lobster Case
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


In this session, we introduce decision trees and the decision tree methodology from an intuitive point of view without any formal theory of probability. This easy-to-grasp model helps students to structure a decision problem, and also helps students see the need for a theory of probability in order to model uncertainty.

In-class discussion of the Kendall Crab and Lobster case. Students prepare the following questions: What are the choices that Jeff Daniels faces? What are the sources of uncertainty in the case? What are the consequences of the various possible outcomes? What course of action would you recommend for Jeff Daniels?

Decision Analysis II – Conditional Probabilities
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


In this class session, we cover the laws of probability, including conditional probability and the arithmetic of conditional probability. We use probability tables instead of a "Bayes' Theorem" formula in order to keep the concepts as intuitive as possible.

In-class discussion of the "Great Apps of Ann Arbor" case.

Discrete Probability Distributions
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


The next three classes lay the basic groundwork of probability distributions. We will see how data can be characterized as observed values of random variables, and we will study three important probability distributions: the uniform distribution, the binomial distribution, and the Normal distribution.

In this first session, we cover discrete random variables and probability distributions, including the binomial distribution.

Continuous Probability Distributions
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
We cover linear functions of a random variable, covariance and correlation of two random variables, and sums of random variables. We show how these concepts lead to important use in finance and in operations. In the second part of this session, we introduce continuous random variables, the probability density function, and the cumulative distribution function. We cover the continuous uniform distribution and the Normal distribution in detail, showing how the Normal distribution arises in models of many management problems.

The Normal Distribution
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In this class we continue our coverage of the Normal distribution. We cover sums of Normally distributed random variables and we then cover the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem points the way to statistical inference.

Simulation I – The Gentle Lentil Case
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


In this session we return to constructing and using models, in this case simulation models based on random number generators. We develop the key ideas of simulation with a prototypical management decision problem that necessitates combining different random variables. We show how simulation models are constructed, used, and analyzed in a management context.

In-class discussion of the Gentle Lentil case.

Regression Models II
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This class is the second of three sessions on linear regression models. Particular care is taken to ensure that students learn how to evaluate and validate a regression model. We also discuss warnings and issues that arise in using linear regression, and we cover extended regression modeling techniques such as nonlinear transformations and the use of dummy variables.

Regression Illustrated

{{< tdopen >}}


In this class session we present examples of how one goes about constructing, solving, and interpreting regression models.

Students prepare the analyses of two regression mini-cases, "Predicting Heating Oil Consumption at _Oilplus_" and "Executive Compensation" for in-class discussion.

Quiz
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
The 1.5-hour quiz takes place during regular class time. The quiz covers all of the material we have considered so far in the course. The quiz will be closed-book with no notes allowed. Students may use a non-communications-type calculator, but no communications devices (cellphones, graphing calculators) are allowed. We provide a sheet of formulas that are pre-posted on the course website before the quiz.

Introduction to Linear Optimization Modeling
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In this session we will cover the basics of linear optimization, including formulations, key concepts, and graphical solution methods. We develop the basic concepts for constructing, solving, and interpreting the solution of a linear optimization model. We also present instructional material on using linear optimization in a spreadsheet.

Solving and Analyzing Linear Optimization Models
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
We will cover computer solution methods for linear optimization, basic sensitivity and economic analysis of a linear optimization model, as well as extensions of linear optimization and applied optimization modeling in general. In addition to standard topics, we also focus on shadow prices and the importance of sensitivity analysis of a linear optimization model as an adjunct to informed decision-making. As an optional topic, we will show how to model uncertainty in linear optimization using two-stage linear optimization under uncertainty.

Dynamic Optimization for Retail Pricing
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


This session covers dynamic optimization models, whose uses are vast: from power system pricing, to revenue management for airlines, hotels, car rental companies, to retail pricing, and even including military wargame modeling.

We will have an in-class discussion and analysis of the case "Pricing Strategies for Power-Pro's MBA Laptop Bag" case and we will build and then solve an optimization model for determining optimal retails pricing.
