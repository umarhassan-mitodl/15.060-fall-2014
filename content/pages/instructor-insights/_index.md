## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend at least 9 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Lectures met 2 times per week for 90 minutes per session; 21 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
- Recitations met 1 time per week for 1 hour per session; optional attendance.
- Some lecture sessions were didactic, others relied heavily upon interactive discussion within the class, as well as cold-calling, especially when discussing case studies.
- Recitation periods were used to review and reinforce material covered in the lectures, and to review the ins and outs of using modeling software for the course. Recitations were run by the Teaching Assistants.

### Out of Class

Students prepared readings, team and individual cases and write-ups, individual homework assignments, and studied for exams outside of class.
